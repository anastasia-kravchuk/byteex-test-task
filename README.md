# 🧵 Byteex Landing Page (Test Assignment)

This project is a responsive landing page built as a **test assignment**, based on a provided Figma design and powered by **Contentful CMS**.

The goal of the task was to demonstrate:
- clean and scalable React architecture
- proper data fetching from Contentful
- responsive layout implementation
- semantic HTML and BEM-based SCSS structure

## [Live DEMO](https://byteex-test-task.netlify.app/)

## ✨ Tech Stack

- **React + TypeScript**
- **Vite**
- **SCSS**
- **Contentful CMS (Delivery API)**
- **GitHub Pages / Netlify (deployment)**

---

## 📦 Features

- Fully responsive layout (mobile → desktop)
- Content managed via Contentful
- Custom React hooks for each content type
- Asset handling via Contentful `includes` + asset mapping
- Clean separation of:
  - UI components
  - data fetching logic
  - types

## 📌 Important Note

The original design uses **paid fonts** that are not freely available.

To keep the project accessible and easy to run locally,  
I replaced them with the **Inter** font, which is free, open-source, and visually close to the original typography.
